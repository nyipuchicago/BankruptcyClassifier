# BankruptcyClassifier

Public version of a Bankruptcy Classifier I built as the final project for my graduate machine learning course. Three models considered: Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, SVM classifier. This notebook includes the full ML pipeline from data cleaning and preprocessing to error analysis.
